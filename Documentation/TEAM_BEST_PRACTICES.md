## Gitflow Best Practices

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, we adhere to the following Gitflow best practices:

### Branching Model

- **`main` Branch:** Represents the stable, production-ready code. Only releases are merged into `main`.
- **`develop` Branch:** Integration branch for features. All feature branches are merged into `develop`.
- **Feature Branches (e.g., `feature/add-transaction-form`):**
  - Created from `develop`.
  - Used for developing new features.
  - Follow the naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>`.
- **Bugfix Branches (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-error`):**
  - Created from `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes).
  - Used for fixing bugs.
  - Follow the naming convention: `bugfix/<bug-description>`.
- **Release Branches (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`):**
  - Created from `develop` when a release is ready.
  - Used for final release preparations (e.g., version bumps, documentation updates).
  - Follow the naming convention: `release/<version>`.
- **Hotfix Branches (e.g., `hotfix/fix-critical-bug`):**
  - Created from `main` to address critical bugs in production.
  - Merged back into `main` and `develop`.
  - Follow the naming convention: `hotfix/<bug-description>`.

### Naming Conventions

- **Branch Names:** Use lowercase, separate words with hyphens, and follow the specified branch type prefixes (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`).
- **Commit Messages:**
  - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add transaction form," not "Added transaction form").
  - Prefix commits with a scope, if applicable (e.g., `feat(transactions): Add transaction form`).
  - Keep it concise and descriptive.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
  - Use descriptive titles.
  - Provide a detailed description of the changes.
  - Include relevant screenshots or screen recordings.
  - Link to related issues or tasks.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Review Process:** All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.
- **Code Quality:** Ensure code follows our coding standards and best practices.
- **Testing:** Include relevant unit and integration tests.
- **CI/CD:** Ensure all automated tests pass before merging.

### Good Commits

- **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- **Descriptive Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Avoid Large Commits:** Break down large changes into smaller, more manageable commits.

## Using AI to Code

AI tools like GitHub Copilot can significantly boost productivity, but it's essential to use them responsibly and with caution to avoid potential risks.

### Data Leaks

- **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Never input sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal data) into AI tools.
- **Review Prompts:** Carefully review the prompts you use to avoid accidentally revealing sensitive data.

### Code Review

- **Always Review AI-Generated Code:** Treat AI-generated code as suggestions, not as definitive solutions.
- **Understand the Code:** Ensure you fully understand the code generated by AI before incorporating it into your project.

### Organizational Policies

- **Use Only Approved Tools:** Adhere to our organization's policies regarding the use of AI tools. Currently, only GitHub Copilot is approved.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with our organization's guidelines and best practices for AI usage.
- **Report Concerns:** If you encounter any potential security or privacy issues related to AI, report them to your team lead (Daniel Carneiro) if they are related to our project and the security team.

### Best Practices

- **Use AI for Repetitive Tasks:** AI is excellent for generating boilerplate code or performing repetitive tasks.
- **Focus on Logic:** Use AI to assist with syntax and structure, but focus on writing the core business logic yourself.
- **Iterate and Refine:** Use AI as a starting point and iterate on the generated code to meet your specific requirements.

By following these guidelines, we can leverage the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks.

Let's make and keep our application more maintainable, scalable, secure and reliable.
